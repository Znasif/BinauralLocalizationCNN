# Ubuntu 20.04 has GLIBC 2.31 - compatible with VS Code Server
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:20.12-tf1-py3

# Note: TensorFlow 1.15 requires CUDA 10.0, which isn't officially available for Ubuntu 20.04
# We'll use Ubuntu 18.04 base but this won't work with VS Code Server

# Alternative approach: Use Ubuntu 20.04 with manual CUDA installation
# But this is complex. 

# SIMPLER SOLUTION: Use the container without VS Code Server integration
# See Option 2 below
